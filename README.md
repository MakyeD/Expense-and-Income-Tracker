# McDonalds Order System Project - CS1520 Fall 2023 # 
CS1520 Final Project Completed in the fall of 2023 at the University of Pittsburgh. This application uses flask, sqlalchemy, javascript, and python to mimic a McDonalds order system.
"main_app.py" Is the user-facing system that presents a menu and to order any number of the listed items from. After submission, the customer name, order details, and price is posted to the sql database. The kitchen-facing scren refreshes every 15 seconds and retrives the orders from the database and displays them.
